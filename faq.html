          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>A <strong>VTC</strong> (Voiture de Transport avec Chauffeur) is a licensed, pre-booked private hire car service. Unlike a regular Paris taxi you hail on the street, a VTC is reserved in advance with a confirmed, fixed price. Your driver is assigned to your booking, will track your flight in real time, and will be waiting for you at the airport arrivals hall with a name board — ready to help with your luggage and take you directly to your destination.</p>

Just contact us by phone on <a href="tel:+33143327081"><strong>+33 (0)1 43 327 081</strong></a> or email us at <a href="mailto:Contact@groupbluevanparis.com"><strong>Contact@groupbluevanparis.com</strong></a> with your travel details including: flight number, arrival date and time, pickup location, destination address, number of passengers, and any special requirements such as a baby seat.

            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>We recommend booking at least 24 hours in advance to guarantee availability, especially during peak travel periods such as summer, school holidays, and public holidays. However, we also accept last-minute bookings subject to driver availability. For large groups or special VIP requirements, booking several days in advance is advisable.</p>

            Can I book a return journey at the same time?

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Absolutely. We encourage you to book your return journey at the same time. Simply provide us with your departure flight details, and we will arrange for a driver to collect you from your hotel, apartment, or other address in Paris and take you to the airport in good time for your flight. Booking both legs together may also attract a discounted combined rate.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>All our prices are <strong>fixed and agreed upfront</strong> before your journey begins. There are no meters, no traffic surcharges, no late-night supplements, and no hidden fees. The price you receive in your booking confirmation is exactly the price you pay — nothing more. This is one of the key advantages of booking a VTC service over a standard Paris taxi.</p>
